/**
 * @title StakingPool Contract
 * @notice This contract manages a staking pool where users can stake VAB tokens to earn rewards based on their staked
 * amount and participation in governance activities.
 *
 * The contract handles staking, unstaking, calculating rewards, and distributing rewards to stakers.
 * It also facilitates  participation in governance by allowing stakers to vote on proposals and earn rewards based on
 * their voting activities.
 *
 * Stakers can:
 * - Stake VAB tokens to participate in the staking pool.
 * - Earn rewards based on the amount staked and their participation in governance activities such as voting on
 * proposals.
 * - Unstake their tokens after a lock period to withdraw their staked amount and any earned rewards.
 * - Vote on proposals submitted to the governance system, this includes governance and film proposals.
 *
 * The contract calculates rewards based on the staking period, the amount staked, and the user's participation in
 * governance.
 *
 * During a migration process, stakers can withdraw their staked tokens and any accrued rewards without earning new
 * rewards until the migration is complete.
 * The contract ensures that stakers can safely withdraw their funds during this period
 * while maintaining the integrity of the staking pool and ongoing governance activities.
 *
 * Stakers are informed about the migration status, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding their staked
 * amounts and participation in governance activities.
 *
 * This contract plays a critical role in the Vabble ecosystem by providing a secure and efficient platform for staking
 * VAB tokens for participating in governance decisions and earning rewards.
