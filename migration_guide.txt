1. Deploy New Contract: 
2. Create Proposal: Submit a proposal to cease staking rewards 
    Property->proposalRewardFund
3. Vote: Vote on the proposal
    Vote->voteToRewardAddress
4. Approve Proposal and start Migration
    4.1 Vote->setDAORewardAddress
    4.2 If proposal is approved(passed), contract start migration automatically(triggered)
        totalMigrationVAB will be calculated
            calculate the total amount of reward for each member
            put it into outstandingReward of each member (stakeInfo.outstandingReward)
            totalMigrationVAB = totalRewardAmount - sum of outstandingReward for all members
        migrationStatus will be chnaged from 0 to 1
            migrationStatus:
                0: Not Started (Normal)
                1: Started
                2: Ended
    4.3 If migration is started,
        All rewarding action will be stopped (StakingPool->addRewardToPool)
            VabbleDAO->proposalFilmCreate will be stopped
            VabbleFund->fundProcess will be processed
            Property->proposalValue will be stopped
        All stacking/devoting action will be stopped
            StakingPool->stakeVAB will be stopped
            StakingPool->depositVAB will be stopped
        Lock Period will be ignored 
            StakingPool->unstakeVAB can be called at any time
            StakingPool->withdrawReward can be called at any time
5. Move VAB from StakingPool, StudioPool(VabbleDAO), EdgePool(Ownable) to new DAO Reward Address
    Call StakingPool->withdrawAllFund though audit action
    5.1 Move totalMigrationVAB to new DAO Reward Address
        totalRewardAmount = totalRewardAmount - totalMigrationVAB;
        totalMigrationVAB = 0;
        transfer totalMigrationVAB from Staking Pool to new DAO Reward Address
    5.2 Move All balance of StudioPool to new DAO Reward Address
    5.3 Move All balance of EdgePool to new DAO Reward Address
    5.4 migrationStatus <- 2 (Ended)

    Even though withdrawAllFund is called (migration is ended), 
        Each staker can still unstake
        Each staker can still withdraw the reward(outstandingReward)
        Each depositor can still withdraw
6. When all stakers and depositor have withdrawn, then Migration is done.
