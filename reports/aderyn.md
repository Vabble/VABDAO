# High Issues

## H-1: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function.

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Deprecated OpenZeppelin functions should not be used

Openzeppelin has deprecated several functions and replaced with newer versions. Please consult https://docs.openzeppelin.com/

	```solidity
	            Helper.safeApprove(_token, _spender, _amount);
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	    event WhitelistUpdated(address indexed contract_, bool status);

	```solidity
	    event SwapExecuted(address indexed fromToken, address indexed toToken, uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut);
	```

</details>



## L-4: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-5: Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function

	```solidity

## L-6: Costly operations inside loops.

Invoking `SSTORE`operations in loops may lead to Out-of-gas errors. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.
