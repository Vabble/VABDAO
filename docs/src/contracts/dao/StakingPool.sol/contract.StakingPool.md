This contract manages a staking pool where users can stake VAB tokens to earn rewards based on their staked
amount and participation in governance activities.
The contract handles staking, unstaking, calculating rewards, and distributing rewards to stakers.
It also facilitates  participation in governance by allowing stakers to vote on proposals and earn rewards based on
their voting activities.
Stakers can:
- Stake VAB tokens to participate in the staking pool.
- Earn rewards based on the amount staked and their participation in governance activities such as voting on
proposals.
- Unstake their tokens after a lock period to withdraw their staked amount and any earned rewards.
- Vote on proposals submitted to the governance system, this includes governance and film proposals.
The contract calculates rewards based on the staking period, the amount staked, and the user's participation in
governance.
During a migration process, stakers can withdraw their staked tokens and any accrued rewards without earning new
rewards until the migration is complete.
The contract ensures that stakers can safely withdraw their funds during this period
while maintaining the integrity of the staking pool and ongoing governance activities.
Stakers are informed about the migration status, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding their staked
amounts and participation in governance activities.
This contract plays a critical role in the Vabble ecosystem by providing a secure and efficient platform for staking
VAB tokens for participating in governance decisions and earning rewards.
