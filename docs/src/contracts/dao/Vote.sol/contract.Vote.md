*This contract facilitates voting processes related to governance and film approvals within the Vabble ecosystem.
It integrates with other contracts like `StakingPool`, `Property`, and `VabbleDAO` to manage voting rights, stake
amounts, and proposal approval logic.
The contract allows stakeholders (stakers) to vote on proposals regarding governance decisions and films.
The contract includes functionality for:
- Voting on governance proposals for auditor changes, reward address changes, adding film board members and various
property changes.
- Voting on film proposals for funding types, such as listing or distribution.
- Approving film proposals based on voting outcomes.
- Tracking voting periods and stakeholder participation.
Governance proposals and film proposals undergo distinct voting periods, ensuring transparent decision-making and
stakeholder engagement. Stakers are incentivized through rewards managed by the `StakingPool` contract, which
distributes rewards based on voting activity and stake amounts.
This contract is part of the broader Vabble ecosystem governance framework, enabling efficient and fair governance
decision-making processes. It enforces governance rules defined in the `Property` contract and interacts with the
`VabbleDAO` for film-related decisions and status updates.*
